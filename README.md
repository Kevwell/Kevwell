Hi there 

I'm a passionate data scientist with a solid foundation in academia and a strong drive to excel in the world of technology. Armed with a PhD in Chemistry and over 10 years of invaluable research experience, I bring a unique perspective to the field of data science.

My journey began in the realm of chemistry, where I meticulously explored the intricate world of molecules and their interactions. Through my extensive research, I managed and led projects focused on the discovery of anticancer agents, antimicrobial agents, and acaricidal agents.

Fueling my enthusiasm for innovation, I have cultivated expertise in drug discovery, organic synthesis, biocatalysis, and green chemistry. My multifaceted background enables me to approach data science challenges with creativity and a keen eye for practical applications.
